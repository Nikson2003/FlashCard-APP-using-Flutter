# Flashcard App using Flutter

A simple and interactive Flashcard app built using Flutter, where users can add, edit, and delete flashcards. The app helps users to create custom flashcards with a question and answer format, allowing for easy learning and revision.

## Features

- **Add Flashcards**: Create custom flashcards by entering a question and answer.
- **Edit Flashcards**: Modify existing flashcards.
- **Delete Flashcards**: Remove flashcards from the list.
- **User Interface**: Simple and clean interface to manage flashcards with options to edit and delete.
- **Visual Appealing**: The cards have a border color representing the question or answer or untapped card.
- **Smoothness**: When tapped on the card, it gets flipped and shows the answer side if it was previously displaying the question side and vice versa. 

## Technologies Used

- **Flutter**: A UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications for mobile from a single codebase.
